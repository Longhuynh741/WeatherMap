This Project is aimed towards building upon Javascript, JQuery, and Web-API foundations. The completion of this project will require prior knowledge of several Javascript principles including: Arrays, for loops, if/else statements, and variable creations. Newer concepts such as JQuery and APIs will be heavily focused as well. You will be tasked with making an Weather Map Dashboard. The generator must be able to follow these criteria:

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
```

# Installation

You will start this project from scratch with no source code. You are given a demo/preview of the expected results in your assets folder. Using your code editor, you will create the html files, css files, java script files, and any other files you feel are relevant. This project will also use BootStrap as an aide so be sure to include the CDN into your project. You will also need to implement the openweathermap API into your code in order to run your AJAX functions. 

# Usage

Use VSS code editor to make changes where neccessary. For this project, be sure to reference the demo to make sure you are on the right track. Make sure the code functions not only on your local branch, but on the published Github website as well.

# Credits

I do not own the original source code which this project is based on. It was provided to me through GA-Tech Bootcamp. Any adjustments I made to the original source code was of my own with guidance and instructions from the bootcamp instructors and classmates.
